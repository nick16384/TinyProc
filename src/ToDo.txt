Future (optional) ideas:
Simulate different access times
Add muxers / demuxers
External HW interfaces, Interrupts
Caches, virtual memory -> MMU
Change CU code to better resemble binary logic

Mark methods with Debug_ when they are not part of the microarch and only there to provide debugging info.

Refactor RawMemory.Debug_DumpAll() to look more pleasing.

Add ALU Accumulator register

Split instruction cycles into more logical clock cycles (= Add more NextClock() wait points)
-> Currently one continuous operation: Not realistic

INC / INC2 / DEC instructions, since they perform faster with special registers outputting these values

ALU: Convert to pure logic, so that changes made to A, B, OpCode and SR propagate directly after set to R.

Fix ALU A and B registers not receiving updates, but R register results are stored corretly.

Warning: When changing ALU opcode changes to update bus data, respect order of operations in control unit!

When printing register codes, also print names for better debugging info (e.g. 0x00000001 --> "GP1")

New meta instructions:
STORI (Store immediate value at address in register)
